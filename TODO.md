# TODO

- GUI appends command entries with a drop down for operation and a spinner/drop down for value (which could be moved up and down with drag&drop or arrows and could be deleted)
- generate GUI components in alignment with programming commands
- ability to move GUI commands
- ability to delete GUI commands
- Always keep a new GUI command hanging at the bottom
- Color `color` strings (e.g. `red`) in code_text widget
- Show an arrow in the direction the stick figure is going next
- Share drawn image by email
- Post drawn image online in the cloud along with the program for everyone to see via a link.
- Add app icon
- Consider caching of commands
- Consider caching of polygons up per command
- Save program (Save... & Save menu items with CMD+S keyboard shortcut/accelerator)
- Load program (start at samples path)
- Undo/Redo support
- Make any command that fails to be interpreted an empty command (that way we can add comments)
- Extract string fuzz matching algorithm into its own Ruby gem
- Extract samples from jar in packaged app run
- Consider doing drawing async
- Consider delaying execution by a 200 milliseconds while typing
- Optimize performance for high repetition counts or show a dialog saying "redrawing" if redrawing takes too long (longer than 5 seconds) with a cancel button
- Avoid re-duplicating polygons that already exist (thus optimizing performance)
- Support easy listing/loading of included samples

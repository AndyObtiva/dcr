# TODO

- Fix repaint issue when deleting a repeat from the end by highlighting entire repeat command line and deleting
- Add `#eql?` and `#hash` to `Dcr::Polygon`
- Make drawing happen through the left hand of the stick figure (end of left arm)
- Process commands as case-insensitive
- Tolerate errors in typing colors
- Support concatenation of number to text (as tolerating error) (e.g. f3, backward9, right80)
- show arrow pointing in the right direction (based on program.angle)
- Consider dropping a stick figure after every forward/backward command
- draw from between the legs of the stick figure
- GUI appends command entries with a drop down for operation and a spinner/drop down for value (which could be moved up and down with drag&drop or arrows and could be deleted)
- generate GUI components in alignment with programming commands
- ability to move GUI commands
- ability to delete GUI commands
- Always keep a new GUI command hanging at the bottom
- Color color strings (e.g. 'red') in code_text widget
- Rerun all commands from the start on every change to the command_text widget that is parsable
- Validate entered text
- Parse and convert entered text into commands (converting colors to symbols)
- Show an arrow in the direction the stick figure is going next
- Save a program.
- Save drawn image into a file
- Share drawn image by email
- Posted drawn image online in the cloud along with the program for everyone to see via a link.
- Add icon
- Consider caching of commands
- Consider caching of polygons up per command
- Consider execution delays while typing (delay to evaluate by 200ms for example)
- Save program (Save... & Save menu items with CMD+S keyboard shortcut/accelerator)
- Load program
